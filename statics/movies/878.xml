Finding the idol, the scientists realize it could be the most powerful weapon in the world and remove the lenses that energize it, distributing them among themselves so that no one would be able to use the idol by himself. Back in the US, Billy Batson, as Captain Marvel, wages a battle against an evil, hooded figure, the Scorpion, who hopes to accumulate all five lenses, thereby gaining control of the super-powerful weapon.</body><directors>John English.威廉·惠特尼</directors><actors>汤姆·泰勒.Frank Coghlan Jr..William `Billy` Benedict</actors></doc>
