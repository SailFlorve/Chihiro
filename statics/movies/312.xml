A note on the fridge says: “Your friend Luigi has died. P.S. I took the car”. The problem is that he does not even remember who this guy Luigi is. This is just the beginning of a tragicomic day during which he will be plunged into the folly of the world. One of those days that changes your life forever.</body><director>亚丽桑卓·阿罗纳迪奥.米莱娜·伍柯迪克.尼可洛·森尼.皮埃拉·迪格利·埃斯波斯蒂.罗可·帕帕雷奥.亚丽桑卓·阿罗纳迪奥.米莱娜·伍柯迪克.尼可洛·森尼.皮埃拉·迪格利·埃斯波斯蒂.罗可·帕帕雷奥.亚丽桑卓·阿罗纳迪奥</director><actors>米莱娜·伍柯迪克.尼可洛·森尼.皮埃拉·迪格利·埃斯波斯蒂.罗可·帕帕雷奥.米莱娜·伍柯迪克.尼可洛·森尼.皮埃拉·迪格利·埃斯波斯蒂.罗可·帕帕雷奥</actors></doc>
