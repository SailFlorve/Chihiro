Her victim this time is a poor soul who had the misfortune to hitch a ride from Wanda. Once he snaps out of the hypnotic spell, he wants nothing further to do with his captive. That's when Wanda hands the hapless fellow over to a gang of female S&amp;M freaks. And that's how it goes for nearly 70 minutes. ~ Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide</body><directors>Greg Corarito</directors><actors>Katharine Shubeck.Richard Compton.Janine Sweet.Lindy Birde</actors></doc>
